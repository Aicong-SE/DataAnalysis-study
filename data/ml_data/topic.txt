He spent a lot of time studying cryptography.
In the United States around the end of the 19th century, spaghetti was offered in restaurants as Spaghetti Italienne (which likely consisted of noodles cooked past al dente, and a mild tomato sauce flavored with easily found spices and vegetables such as cloves, bay leaves, and garlic) and it was not until decades later that it came to be commonly prepared with oregano or basil.
You need to have a very good understanding of modern encryption systems in order to work there.
Those codes are generated by a specialized machine.
The popularity of spaghetti spread throughout Italy after the establishment of spaghetti factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of spaghetti for the Italian market.
Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary.
Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water.
It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine.
We need to make sure only the authorized parties can read the message.
Italian spaghetti is made from durum wheat semolina, but elsewhere it may be made with other kinds of flour.
The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the information age.
Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export.
